Shows a timer above dropped items, letting you know when they're going to despawn. Handy for preventing items from despawning, because you didn't know they're about to despawn.

**Mod is needed on the server due to Minecraft not communicating to clients of when the item is going to despawn, causing an inaccurate timer.**
